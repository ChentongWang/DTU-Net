# DTU-Net
## Background
The repository contains the PyTorch implementations for the paper "DTU-Net: A Multi-Scale Dilated Transformer Network for Nonlinear Hyperspectral Unmixing".

DTU-Net: A Multi-Scale Dilated Transformer Network for Nonlinear Hyperspectral Unmixing,
C. Wang, J. Gao, F. Zhu, A. Halimi, and C. Richard,
IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, vol. 64, 2026. DOI: 10.1109/TGRS.2026.3658361

## Quick Start for Comparative Experiments
For those looking to replicate the comparative experiments, we provide "one-click" execution scripts. Just run the script named after the specific dataset.

## Any Feedback
This is my first research work in this field. As a newcomer, I am eager to learn and improve. Any feedback, suggestions, or discussions are highly appreciated!
